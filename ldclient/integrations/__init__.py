        The format of the data files is described in the SDK Reference Guide on
        `Reading flags from a file <https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/features/flags-from-files#python>`_.
        Note that in order to use YAML, you will need to install the ``pyyaml`` package.

          package is installed, in which case YAML is also allowed.
        :param auto_update: (default: false) True if the data source should watch for changes to the source file(s)
          and reload flags whenever there is a change. The default implementation of this feature is based on
          polling the filesystem, which may not perform well; if you install the ``watchdog`` package, its
          native file watching mechanism will be used instead. Note that auto-updating will only work if all
          of the files you specified have valid directory paths at startup time.
        :param poll_interval: (default: 1) the minimum interval, in seconds, between checks for file
          modifications-- used only if ``auto_update`` is true, and if the native file-watching mechanism from
          ``watchdog`` is not being used.
        :param force_polling: (default: false) True if the data source should implement auto-update via
          polling the filesystem even if a native mechanism is available. This is mainly for SDK testing.
