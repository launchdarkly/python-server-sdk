## Verifying SDK build provenance with GitHub artifact attestations

LaunchDarkly uses [GitHub artifact attestations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/using-artifact-attestations/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds) to help developers make their supply chain more secure by ensuring the authenticity and build integrity of our published SDK packages.

LaunchDarkly publishes provenance about our SDK package builds using [GitHub's `actions/attest` action](https://github.com/actions/attest). These attestations are stored in GitHub's attestation API and can be verified using the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).

To verify build provenance attestations, we recommend using the [GitHub CLI `attestation verify` command](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_attestation_verify). Example usage for verifying SDK packages is included below:

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->
```
# Set the version of the SDK to verify
SDK_VERSION=9.15.0
```
<!-- x-release-please-end -->

```
# Download package from PyPI
$ pip download --only-binary=:all: launchdarkly-server-sdk==${SDK_VERSION}

# Verify provenance using the GitHub CLI
$ gh attestation verify launchdarkly_server_sdk-${SDK_VERSION}-py3-none-any.whl --owner launchdarkly
```

Below is a sample of expected output.

```
Loaded digest sha256:... for file://launchdarkly_server_sdk-9.15.0-py3-none-any.whl
Loaded 1 attestation from GitHub API

The following policy criteria will be enforced:
- Predicate type must match:................ https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1
