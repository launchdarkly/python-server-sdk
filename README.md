Supported Python versions
-------------------------

This version of the LaunchDarkly SDK is compatible with Python 2.7, and Python 3.3 through 3.7.

Quick setup
-----------

1. Install the Python SDK with `pip`

        pip install ldclient-py

2. Configure the library with your sdk key:

        import ldclient

3. Get the client:

        ldclient.set_sdk_key("your sdk key")
        client = ldclient.get()


HTTPS proxy
------------
Python's standard HTTP library provides built-in support for the use of a HTTPS proxy. If the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable is present then the SDK will proxy all network requests through the URL provided.

How to set the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable on Mac/Linux systems:
```
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080
```


How to set the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable on Windows systems:
```
set HTTPS_PROXY=https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080
```

Or it can be set from within python:
```
os.environ["https_proxy"] = "https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080"
```


If your proxy requires authentication then you can prefix the URN with your login information:
```
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://user:pass@web-proxy.domain.com:8080
```
or
```
set HTTPS_PROXY=http://user:pass@web-proxy.domain.com:8080
```


Your first feature flag
-----------------------

1. Create a new feature flag on your [dashboard](https://app.launchdarkly.com)
2. In your application code, use the feature's key to check whether the flag is on for each user:

        if client.variation("your.flag.key", {"key": "user@test.com"}, False):
            # application code to show the feature
        else:
            # the code to run if the feature is off

Supported Python versions
----------
The SDK is tested with the most recent patch releases of Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6. Python 2.6 is no longer supported.

Learn more
-----------

Check out our [documentation](http://docs.launchdarkly.com) for in-depth instructions on configuring and using LaunchDarkly. You can also head straight to the [complete reference guide for this SDK](http://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/python-sdk-reference).

Testing
-------

We run integration tests for all our SDKs using a centralized test harness. This approach gives us the ability to test for consistency across SDKs, as well as test networking behavior in a long-running application. These tests cover each method in the SDK, and verify that event sending, flag evaluation, stream reconnection, and other aspects of the SDK all behave correctly.

[![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/launchdarkly/python-client/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/launchdarkly/python-client/coverage) The Code Climate coverage does not include the coverage provided by this integration test harness.

About LaunchDarkly
-----------

* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard.  With LaunchDarkly, you can:
    * Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
    * Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
    * Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
    * Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the ‘gold’ plan get access to more features than users in the ‘silver’ plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
